### 1.Bubble sort algorithm

* main.cs -> bubble sort alogrithm

* how to run the program -> csc main.cs && mono main.exe

 - dotnet is not used to run the program
 
* Adjusting the program -> You have to change the array that needs to be sorted after the method to get it sorted for a different array of elements

* How the program works is mentioned in the comments of of the program itself.



### 2. Merge sort algorithm

* example2.cs -> mergesort algorithm

* How to run the program -> csc example2.cs && mono example2.exe

 - dotnet is not used to run the program. no building here

* Adjusting the program -> You have to change the array that needs to be sorted after the method to get it sorted for a different array of elements


### 3.Tasks to do for both

- [x] Basic implementation with comments

- [x] Markdown completion

- [ ] Time it function for each run

- [ ] Implementation in other languages eg:- python, c and c++

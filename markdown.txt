1. Bubble sort algorithm

main.cs -> bubble sort

how to run the program -> csc main.cs && mono main.exe

dotnet is not used to run this project eventhough its in one


Adjusting the program -> You have to change the array after the method to get it sorted for a
different array of elements

How the program works is mentioned in the comments of the program itself.

working on time it function to check how fast it takes to sort the array


2. Merge Sort algorithm

example2.cs -> Merge sort

how to run the program -> csc example2.cs && mono example2.exe

dotnet is not used to run this.eventhough its in a project.

Adjusting the program -> same rules apply as for the bubble sort program
